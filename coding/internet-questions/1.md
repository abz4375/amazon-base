Question
. Code Question 1 As part of your Day 1 orientation at , your new team is hosting a programming challenge. You've been asked to participate in completing the following task. Given an array of integers, perform certain operations in order to satisfy some constraints. The constraints are as follows: The first array element must be 1. For all other elements, the difference between adjacent integers must not be greater than 1. In other words, for 1 si

Basic Answer
Solution By Steps
Step 1: Initialize the Array Initialize the array with the first element as 1, as per the first constraint.

Step 2: Iterate Through the Array Start iterating from the second element (index 1) to the end of the array.

Step 3: Adjust Each Element For each element, ensure it does not exceed the previous element by more than 1. If it does, adjust it to be exactly 1 more than the previous element.

Step 4: Return the Modified Array After iterating through the array and making necessary adjustments, return the modified array.

Final Answer
The modified array that satisfies the given constraints.

This approach ensures that the array starts with 1 and maintains a difference of at most 1 between adjacent elements, fulfilling the specified requirements.

python solution :

```py
def modify_array(arr):
    # First element must be 1
    arr[0] = 1
    
    # Iterate through array starting from second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check difference with previous element
        if arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 1:
            # Adjust current element to be at most 1 more than previous
            arr[i] = arr[i-1] + 1
            
    return arr

# Example usage
input_arr = [5, 3, 8, 2, 1]
result = modify_array(input_arr)
print(result) # [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]

```

another correct code


```py

    # First element must be 1
    arr[0] = 1
    
    # Iterate through array starting from second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check difference with previous element (both positive and negative)
        if abs(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) > 1:
            # Adjust current element to be at most 1 different from previous
            if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:
                arr[i] = arr[i-1] + 1
            else:
                arr[i] = arr[i-1] - 1
            
    return arr

# Example usage
input_arr = [5, 3, 8, 2, 1]
result = modify_array(input_arr)
print(result) # [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]
