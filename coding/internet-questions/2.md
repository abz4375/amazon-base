 Code Question 1 Your team at is building a quiz-style application to help students prepare fora certification exams. Each quiz module tests one or more subjects and limits the number of answers students can provide. You have been asked to examine the impact of this limit on the ability of students to "pass" certain subjects within quiz modules. To do this, please review and solve for the following: Imagine a student has already answered answered[i] questions in each of the the ith subjects, and still has time to answer a total of q more questions overall. For each ith subject, the number of questions answered has to be at least needed[i] in order to pass. Determine the maximum number of subjects the student can pass if the q additional answered questions are optimally distributed among the subjects. For example, consider that there are n = 2 subjects and needed = [4, 5] answered questions, respectively, to pass. Imagine the student has answered answered = [2. 4/ questions in the two subjects so far, and can answer another q = 1 questions across all subjects combined. In that case, the best outcome is to answer an additional question in the second subject, in order to pass it, as 2 more answers are required to pass the first subject. The maximum number of subjects that can be passed is 1. Function Description Complete the function findMaximumNum in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the maximum number of subjects that can be passed. findMaximumNum has the following parameter(s):

Key Concept
Greedy Algorithm

UndergraduateScienceComputer Science
A greedy algorithm is a top-down approach that makes the best optimal choice at each step. It doesn't consider the overall optimal solution, focusing only on the immediate best option. This can lead to a locally optimal solution, but not necessarily a globally optimal one.

Basic Answer
To solve the problem of determining the maximum number of subjects a student can pass given their current answers and the additional questions they can answer, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the Inputs
We have:

answered: an array where answered[i] is the number of questions already answered in the ith subject.
needed: an array where needed[i] is the number of questions required to pass the ith subject.
q: the total number of additional questions the student can answer.
Step 2: Calculate the Deficit for Each Subject
For each subject, calculate how many more questions are needed to pass:

deficit[i] = max(0, needed[i] - answered[i]) This means if the student has already answered enough questions, the deficit will be 0.
Step 3: Sort the Deficits
Sort the deficit array in ascending order. This allows us to prioritize subjects that require fewer additional questions to pass.

Step 4: Distribute the Additional Questions
Iterate through the sorted deficit array and keep track of how many subjects can be passed:

For each deficit[i], check if q is greater than or equal to deficit[i].
If yes, subtract deficit[i] from q and increment the count of passed subjects.
If no, break the loop as we cannot pass any more subjects.
Step 5: Return the Result
The count of subjects that can be passed is the final answer.

Implementation
Here is how the function can be implemented in Python:

def findMaximumNum(answered, needed, q):
    # Step 1: Calculate the deficit for each subject
    deficit = [max(0, needed[i] - answered[i]) for i in range(len(answered))]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the deficits
    deficit.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Distribute the additional questions
    passed_subjects = 0
    for d in deficit:
        if q >= d:
            q -= d
            passed_subjects += 1
        else:
            break  # No more subjects can be passed
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return passed_subjects

# Example usage
n = 2
needed = [4, 5]
answered = [2, 4]
q = 1
print(findMaximumNum(answered, needed, q))  # Output: 1
Final Answer
The maximum number of subjects that can be passed is 1.
