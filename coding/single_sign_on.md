Code Question 2
Developers at Amazon are creating a single sign-on application for the web apps in AWS. In one of its modules, a security code is in the form of a binary string that changes every minute. The characters at a pair of indices i and i + 1 are swapped such that the resulting code is the lexicographically maximum binary string that can be achieved in this step. If it is not possible to make the code lexicographically greater, then the code does not change.
String x is lexicographically greater than string yif either y is a prefix of x (and x+y), or there any / exists such that (0 <= i < min(|x|, |y|)) that y_{l} < x_{1} and for any j(0 <= j < i) * x_{j} = y_{j} Here, |a| denotes the length of the string a.
Given the string code, the initial security code, and an integer k, find the security code after k minutes.
Example
code = "00100101" 
k = 4

Initial Code: "00100101"
k: 4

Minute 1:

Find "01" at index 5.
Swap to get: "00101001".
Minute 2:

Find "01" at index 4.
Swap to get: "00110001".
Minute 3:

Find "01" at index 3.
Swap to get: "00110100".
Minute 4:

Find "01" at index 2.
Swap to get: "01010100".
After 4 minutes, we can no longer find any "01" pairs to swap.

Final Answer
The security code after 4 minutes is "01010100".

Key Concept
Lexicographical order

UndergraduateScienceComputer Science
Lexicographical order is an ordering of strings where strings are compared character by character. A string is lexicographically greater than another if it comes after it in dictionary order.

Basic Answer
To solve the problem of finding the security code after k minutes, we need to follow a systematic approach. The goal is to swap adjacent characters in the binary string to achieve the lexicographically maximum string possible after k swaps.

Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to swap adjacent characters in the binary string to make it lexicographically larger. The string can only be modified k times, and we need to determine the final string after these modifications.

Step 2: Identify the Swapping Logic
To make the string lexicographically larger:

We should look for the first occurrence of "01" in the string and swap it to "10".
This swap should be repeated for k iterations or until no more "01" pairs can be found.
Step 3: Implement the Swapping Process
Start with the initial string.
For each minute (up to k):
Search for the first occurrence of "01".
If found, swap it to "10".
If not found, break the loop as no further swaps can increase the string.
Step 4: Execute the Steps
Let's apply this to the example provided:

Initial Code: "00100101"
k: 4

Minute 1:

Find "01" at index 5.
Swap to get: "00101001".
Minute 2:

Find "01" at index 4.
Swap to get: "00110001".
Minute 3:

Find "01" at index 3.
Swap to get: "00110100".
Minute 4:

Find "01" at index 2.
Swap to get: "01010100".
After 4 minutes, we can no longer find any "01" pairs to swap.

Final Answer
The security code after 4 minutes is "01010100".
